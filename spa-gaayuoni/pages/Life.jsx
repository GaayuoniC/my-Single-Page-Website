              Born in Cape Coast, a city along the coast of Ghana in West
              Africa. The first child of five siblings. Raised in Tamale in the
              northern region of Ghana. Father was a teacher and mother was a

          <h3>Teen years</h3>

          <p>
            I attended Tamale Secondary School from 1989 to 1994 and obtained my
            General Certificate of Education, Ordinary Level (GCE O Level).
            After graduation I gained admission to Prebyterian Boys Secondary
            School in Accra, the capital city of Ghana. The school was
            considered one of the best schools in Ghana. After two years of
            studies in Geography, Economics and Government, I passed my Advanced
            Level certification, the equivalent of level 100 in the United
            Kingdom ie first year of university education.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing my Advanced Level education it was mandatory for
            for me to do national service. I was posted as a teacher to Vittin
            Secondary School in Tamale where I taught economics. This was
            1996/97 academic year. During my service I was able to apply for a
            job as a Radio Presenter with the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in
            Tamale.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked as a Radio Presenter and a DJ from 1997 to 1998. During
            this time I introduced more lively programmes and attracted more
            listeners to the radio station. The name of the radio station was
            and still is Radio Savanna FM and my radio name was Kriss Gee.
